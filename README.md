# finalproject
Welcome to our Python-based Blackjack game! This project aims to provide a simple yet engaging version of the classic card game, Blackjack, also known as 21. Our game is designed for single players to play against an automated dealer. Below, you'll find details on the game's features, how to get started, and the basic rules to guide you through playing the game.

Features
Deck Creation and Shuffling: Utilizes a standard 52-card deck with automatic shuffling to ensure fair play.
Betting System: Start the game by setting your desired betting balance. Place bets before each hand to add a strategic layer to the game.
Hand Value Calculation: Automatically calculates the value of both the player's and dealer's hands, considering the special rules for Aces.
Player Decisions: Offers the choice to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep the current hand), with updates on the last card drawn.
Dealer Play Logic: The dealer reveals their hidden card and plays according to the game's rules, aiming for a hand value of 17 or higher.
Outcome Determination: Announces the winner of each hand based on the final hand values, adjusting the player's balance accordingly.
User-Friendly Output: Enhanced output formatting for a better understanding of the game's progress and outcomes.
Getting Started
To play the game, you'll need Python installed on your computer. Clone or download this repository to your local machine, navigate to the project directory, and run the Blackjack_Mccormick.py script in your terminal or command prompt:

python Blackjack_Mccormick.py

Follow the on-screen prompts to set your betting balance, place your bets, and make your moves against the dealer.

How to Play
Set Your Betting Balance: At the start of the game, you'll be asked to enter your desired betting balance.
Place Your Bet: Before each hand, decide how much you want to bet. This amount will be deducted from your balance.
Play Your Hand: Choose to "hit" to take another card or "stand" to keep your current hand. Aim to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
Dealer's Turn: After you stand, the dealer will reveal their hidden card and may take additional cards based on the game's rules.
Determine the Outcome: The game will compare your hand against the dealer's. Win, lose, or tie, your balance will be updated accordingly.
Repeat or Quit: Decide whether to play another hand or end the game based on your current balance.
Rules
The goal is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10. Aces can be worth 1 or 11, whichever is more advantageous.
The dealer must hit until their cards total 17 or higher.
Enjoy the game, and may luck be on your side!
